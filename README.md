# Converting/Preparing .txt to .csv Using Python

## PROBLEM:
- Daily transactional data was only available in text extracts  
- Needed to convert and prepare these files on a daily basis to CSV in order to load into business intelligence softwares  
- Data layout was not appropriate for business intelligence upload and contained unecessary information  
- Manual process of conversion/preparation took up to 25 minutes each day  

## SOLUTION:
- Utilized pandas and numpy packages to automate this daily task  
- Minimized lengthy task to instaneous Python process  

#### ATTACHED FILES:
- Initial .txt extract example  
- Processed .csv extract from example  

#### DISCLAIMER: 
- All data is faux and not representative of myself, employers, clients, or associates.  
- Though the templates and data layout is representative of what I worked with, the populated data itself is completely altered and fabricated.
